# Water-Network-Profiling

This repository houses our team's project on water network analysis, developed during the Fundamentals of Data Science course in our Bachelor's program. 
Our team - Alessandro Botta, Alex Di Corrado, Riccardo Schiera, Luca Buccheri, and Giampiero Fuschi - tackled the challenge of profiling nodes in a simulated water distribution network using data science techniques like PCA and k-means clustering.
